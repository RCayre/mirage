	This class represents an abstract representation of a packet.

	By default, three attributes are included in a Packet :
		* name : it indicates the name of the packet
		* packet : it contains the raw representation of the packet (e.g. a bytes array or a scapy frame)
		* additionalInformations : it contains some external informations about a packet (e.g. frequency, timestamp ...)

	This class represents a *fake* packet, allowing to force the Emitter to wait for a given specific time.

	The time attribute indicates the waiting time needed.

	:Example:
		>>> packet = WaitPacket(time=1.0)
		>>> emitter.sendp(firstPacket,packet,lastPacket) # the emitter sends firstPacket, waits for one second and sends lastPacket
