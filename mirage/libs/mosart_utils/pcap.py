class MosartPCAPDevice(PCAPDevice):
	'''
	This device allows to communicate with a PCAP file in order to write and read Mosart packets.
	
	The corresponding interfaces are : ``<filename>.pcap`` (e.g. "out.pcap")
	
		* If the file exists, the MosartPCAPDevice is in *read* mode, and the corresponding receiver is able to use it as a classic Mosart sniffer.
		* If the file doesn't exist, the MosartPCAPDevice is in *write* mode, and the corresponding emitter is able to write packets in the file.

	The following capabilities are actually supported :

	+-----------------------------------+----------------+
	| Capability			    | Available ?    |
	+===================================+================+
	| SNIFFING_NORMAL                   | yes            |
	+-----------------------------------+----------------+
	| SNIFFING_PROMISCUOUS              | yes            |
	+-----------------------------------+----------------+
	| INJECTING                         | yes            |
	+-----------------------------------+----------------+
	| INJECTING_SYNC                    | no             |
