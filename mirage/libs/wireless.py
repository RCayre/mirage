Indeed, Mirage provides no direct access to the device component from the modules : the hardware components are manipulated thanks to the Emitter class and the Receiver class. Emitters' classes for a given technology inherits from this class.
	The packet are manipulated as an abstract representation in Emitters and Receivers (``mirage.libs.wireless_utils.packets.Packet``) and as a raw representation in Device (e.g. bytes array or scapy frame). That's why an Emitter must implement the following method :

		* convert(self,packet) : this method converts a Mirage Packet into its raw representation

	The constructor of an Emitter needs three parameters :

		* `interface` : indicating the interface to use to instantiate the device, generally it will be provided by the user
		* `packetType` : indicating the child class of Packet for the technology implemented by the Emitter
		* `deviceType` : indicating the child class of Device to instanciate

	A `_task` method is implemented by default. It gets a Mirage Packet from the queue, calls the convert method on it and calls the send method of a Device on the result. If you want to customize this behaviour, you can overload this method.
